if you want that a person will perform a particular task for a specified time such as security underscore admin is basically a elevated privilege role which is given to a security admin for like an hour or I believe that for 45 minutes or 30 minutes so that he can perform his task after that role will automatically removed. So I'm not creating elevated privilege role okay I'm saying description demo. I am clicking on save. Once I saved it see a related list is appeared in front of us which is contain roles applications with role tables custom application users groups. So once we assign this role to any user then that user name will get displayed over here once we assign this role to any group then this role will displayed over here and if you want that it roles contains more roles then we can add more roles in this role okay let's say we have created a role A and then we wanted role B, C, D, E will be come in this A role then we will create those role from here by new and edit button and when we give this role to a particular person then automatically that role will also get assigned to that particular person okay means this role will become a parent and the other role will become a child which automatically assigned once we assign this role to a user. Application with role when we create a ACL or when we create an application then we decided what kind of a role people must have those who can access that application then that will be useful and then that application will be displayed over here okay so later on in other upcoming videos we will be covering these things when we are creating ACLs when we creating applications okay then I will give you a demo that how that particular things will be getting displayed over here okay so for now we will only talk about users and groups okay once I assign this role to user then user name will get displayed over here once I assign this role to group then group name will be displayed over here okay so this is role this is user so through this we have become to know that how to create a user how to create a role now let's talk about groups so type groups see under system administration same we have a groups I'm opening this group in a new tab so see here is a list of groups we already have 30 to 34 groups in a system okay so if I talk about groups so group is basically a set of users who share the common purpose let's say service desk group okay the for example if we are creating an incident ticket then the incident tickets will automatically assign to a service desk group or some task management group which are working on change management or change management group problem management groups okay then change management group is working on a change tickets problem management group is working on a problem tickets service desk is basically working on incident tickets okay so to create a group click on new button so once we click on a new button we have this form we have to fill values in it okay so name of a group I am saying demo okay DEM or demo group and I'm saying manager manager of a group I'm saying he is the person who is taking care of this particular group he is a manager of this group in case if there is some amount which has to be paid to a group on an hourly rate or something you can give the values over here okay group email ID in case if you have let's say demo group and this parent of any group in case you do have and you can give a parent from here as well so I'm not giving right now that's description so here once I say CB also have a dated list over here like rules if this group if we are assigning any rule to this group then we have a role over here if you are sending any member to this group then we have a member over here okay we are creating any group under this group then we can get a group from here as well and we if we want to mention some skills for this group we can also mention through the skills from here okay so now we have created user we have created role we have created group even though we have logged in through the user who does not have any role now so now as well as the use case we have created the user we have created the custom role we have created the group now we have to assign the role to the user directly okay so as I told you that this is a user if I want to assign a role to this user directly then what I will do I will create in this role see I click on edit so I'm assigning him a role which name is ITIL okay so ITIL is a very basic role which is assigned to a user if you want that the person can work on incident person can work on a change ticket person can work on other modules as well so ITIL role is best for that because ITIL is basically out-of-box technician role I can say which is by default provided by service now it's basically a base system role ITIL so I am selecting ITIL over here so I'm giving ITIL role to this user see and I'm clicking on save once I click save see these roles are assigned to this user see so here this ITIL is displayed as false inherited and other roles are true means this ITIL role contain all these roles okay these are in these all roles are inherited by ITIL so once we assign this ITIL role to us these roles are automatically assigned to user okay so this user which we have logged in here he is having a ITIL role so let's see earlier he is having access of only this four let's see how after assigning a ITIL role what all access this user must have okay so I am logging it out and logging it again the name is demo user and the password is 123 I click on login see so now page loads and see now he is having access of more applications now he's having access of like this incident management he is having access of problem management he is having access of change management okay so in this way role works so that basically depends on role that what all access we want to give to a user what all tasks we want a user can perform so we can decide it by giving roles okay so in this way we can give a role to a user individual user okay but basically giving a role to a user directly is not a good practice so good practice is basically that assign a role to a group and then a land at user to that group okay we will also do this in this video so okay so now here see if I refresh this page whole page and if I refresh this group page see no impact in this later days everything is blank okay because I am NOT given this role to anyone I am NOT assigned this group to anyone okay so what I am going to do is now that I am assigning this role to this group so it will give us a understanding that how to assign a role to a group okay so let's see how to assign a role to a group so open the group click on edit you can directly assign a role from here see we have to assign you underscore demo so I am giving this this role to this group click on save see once I click on save see under related list we have a role you underscore demo role which is given to this group let's refresh this role page
