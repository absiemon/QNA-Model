Hello friends, welcome back to my youtube channel, Basic or ServiceNow Learning. So in this video is the first video of ServiceNow training session or I can say ServiceNow training series. The series where we will cover each and every topic mentioned in this syllabus. So I will be covering all these topics one by one in videos. So in today's video I am going to cover this first and second, the introduction to ServiceNow, the configuring users and groups and administration. So the first part is basically a theoretical and the second part is basically a implementation in ServiceNow instance that how to create users, how to create groups, how to create roles, what is users, what are groups, what are roles in ServiceNow. Okay so let's see what we are going to cover in this video. In this video I will give you a brief of ServiceNow basically ServiceNow introduction. We will talk about users, we will talk about roles, we will talk about groups and we will also implement a use case. The use case is like how to create a user, how to create a custom roles, how to create a groups in ServiceNow, how to assign roles to user directly, how to assign roles to group, how to add user to group. Okay if we adding a role right so we have to remove the role as well. Right so how to remove role from the users and how to remove roles from the groups. Okay so these are all use courses we are going to cover in today's video. Okay so let's start with for ServiceNow introduction. So that is basically a theoretical part. So ServiceNow is basically a product of ServiceNow Inc which is an American cloud-based IT management company. It was founded in 2004 by Fred Ludi and its headquarters is in Santa Clara California. ServiceNow is a cloud-based IT management tool so which is used to automate business processes and provides best service to customers and encourages best practices in managing all services as a business. ServiceNow was first introduced as ITSM tool used for various IT activities such as asset management, incident management, change management, problem management, knowledge management, CMDB etc. Okay so basically these incident management, change management, asset management, problem management, these are basically ITSM applications. These are the very basic applications or default applications which is given by the ServiceNow and most of the companies are working on incident management, change management I believe. Okay so these are the very basic modules incident management and change management. But now ServiceNow becomes huge and serves a lot of other applications as well such as ITO applications and ITBM applications. Okay so as we move forward with other sections of this training sessions then we will also cover this ITO applications and ITBM applications. What all ITO applications ServiceNow have, what all ITBM applications ServiceNow have. We will also talk about this ITSM applications in details that what exactly the incident management process is, what exactly the change management process is, problem management process and all. Okay so we will cover all these things in later videos as well. Okay so this is basically an introduction session of ServiceNow. So we are only covering these 30 sections only. ServiceNow platform supports several database technologies such as MySQL, Oracle etc. ServiceNow platform is written in Java apps are written in JavaScript. Okay so if you are learning a ServiceNow you should have a basic knowledge of JavaScript, you must have a basic knowledge of AngularJS, you must have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS at least. Okay if you want to proceed your career in ServiceNow development. Okay but if you are proceeding your career in ServiceNow administration or if you are proceeding your career in ServiceNow functional consultant. Okay so doesn't mean that you know JavaScript or not. Okay so let's see so this is basically a very brief introduction of ServiceNow because most of the time interviewer ask like what is ServiceNow? So at least you should be aware of that what is ServiceNow? What exactly is the tool? This tool is basically for ITSM, ITBM and ITOM applications. It's a cloud-based IT management tool. Okay so here now let's see what is users. Okay so you know that each and every application either it is a software, it is a web application or any application. So it is nothing without users. Okay in ServiceNow user is basically those individuals who can access ServiceNow instance. Okay and to create users in ServiceNow user admin or ITIL role is required. Okay so let's navigate to ServiceNow application so that we can understand that how we can create users and from where we can create a users. Okay so friends this is my ServiceNow personal developer instance. Okay if you are not aware of like what is a personal development instance so I will tell you that this is basically an instance which is provided by ServiceNow. This is free of cost. You can create your access and you can create your instance directly. So I have already posted a video you can check in my playlist so where you can find it how to create your personal developer instance. Okay so you can create your personal developer instance. Once you create that then you have an admin access of that instance. See okay and then you can perform the activities which I am going to perform. Okay and you can also explore the things of ServiceNow instance. So we are talking about users. So before we start with users I'll give you a little brief on this application first. See whatever we are looking here in the left hand side navigation. See these are the applications which are provided by ServiceNow by default is this personal development instance. Okay there lots of application. See okay see I was talking about change earlier right. Change problem, incident. See you have access here. You can access those applications. You can do hands-on if you want to become an incident manager or you want to become a problem manager or change manager. Okay you can do hands-on over here. Okay we have different applications here even though we have a development applications also here. Okay so if you want to do development in ServiceNow you need admin access from where you can access that applications like system definition. See from here we can do development activities. Okay there are lots of other applications as well. So these are the applications which are provided by ServiceNow on the left hand navigation. Each and every applications have different different modules. Okay modules means like in incident we have module called create new. This basically used to create a incident. Assign to means a different list view and this open is basically a list view. So we have different different modules available in each and every applications. Each and every module is for performing different activities. Okay same as here we have see profile impersonate user, elevate role. Okay here we have settings which is tell us that what update set we are using in development sections, what applications we are using right. Like notifications if you want to create some personal notifications or remove some notifications then you can use it from here. Forms, lists, themes, journals. Okay this is basically a search we can say global search you can search anything from here. Okay whatever the data is available in ServiceNow will be displayed to you. Okay so this is basically ServiceNow application so when we move forward with different different tutorials or different different training sessions then you will be come to know more about each and everything. Okay so now let's move to user part first. So to create a user or to find out from where to create a user, tap user in this filter navigator. Once you tap user, see it gives us a filter result. So scroll down under user administration see we have a modules called users, groups and roles. Okay so we are going to cover these users, groups and roles today in this video. Okay so what I am going to do I am going to open this user
